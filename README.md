A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the 'hacktoberfest' topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
