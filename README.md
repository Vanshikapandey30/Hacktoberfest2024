Categories of Algorithms
------------------------

### Backtracking

Explore algorithms that involve backtracking techniques to systematically search for a solution by trying various possibilities and eliminating those that fail to satisfy the constraints. Common examples include the N-Queens problem, Sudoku solver, and permutation generation.

### Bit Manipulation

Discover algorithms that leverage bit-level operations for optimization and efficiency. These techniques can lead to elegant solutions for problems involving sets, combinations, and arithmetic operations.

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

Implement algorithms that tackle complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. This approach is widely used in optimization problems, such as the Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and more.

### Graph Algorithms

Analyze algorithms that operate on graph data structures, covering traversal techniques (like Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford), and more.

### Mathematical Algorithms

Examine algorithms that deal with mathematical computations, including prime factorization, greatest common divisors, and number theory applications.

### Miscellaneous Algorithms

A diverse collection of algorithms that do not fit neatly into the other categories but are crucial for a well-rounded understanding of computer science concepts.

### Recursion

Study recursive algorithms that solve problems by calling themselves with modified parameters, demonstrating the power of recursive thinking in problem-solving.

### Searching Algorithms

Investigate algorithms that efficiently find elements within data structures, focusing on classic methods like binary search and linear search, as well as more advanced searching techniques.

### Sorting Algorithms

Explore various algorithms used for sorting data, including comparison-based methods (like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort) and non-comparison-based techniques (like Counting Sort and Radix Sort).
