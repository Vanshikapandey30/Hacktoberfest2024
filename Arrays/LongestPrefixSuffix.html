Longest Prefix suffix

Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.

NOTE: Prefix and suffix can be overlapping but they should not be equal to the entire string.

Examples :

Input: str = "abab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "ab" is the longest proper prefix and suffix. 
Input: str = "aaaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: "aaa" is the longest proper prefix and suffix. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str| ≤ 106
str contains lower case English alphabets
