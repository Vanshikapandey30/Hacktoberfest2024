Explanation of the Code:
Heuristic Function (heuristic):

This function estimates the cost of reaching the goal from a given node. In this case, the Manhattan distance is used, which is suitable for a grid-like environment.
*Main A Algorithm (a_star_algorithm)**:

Open Set: A priority queue (min heap) where nodes are processed based on their f(n) values.
g_score and f_score: These dictionaries track the cost to reach each node (g_score) and the estimated total cost (f_score).
While Loop: The algorithm continues processing until the goal is found or there are no more nodes to explore. Each node's neighbors are checked, and paths are updated if a better one is found.
Reconstruct Path:

Once the goal is reached, this function retraces the path from the goal to the start using the came_from dictionary, which stores each node's predecessor.
Neighbors Function (get_neighbors):

This function retrieves the neighboring nodes for a given node, ensuring they are within grid bounds and not blocked.
Analysis:
Time Complexity: The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. In the worst case, A* can behave like Dijkstra's algorithm, resulting in a time complexity of

O(∣E∣+∣V∣log∣V∣), where 
𝑉
V is the number of nodes and 
𝐸
E is the number of edges.
Space Complexity: The space complexity can be large because all nodes in the open and closed sets are stored in memory.
Use Case for A*:
A* is commonly used in pathfinding for grid-based games, robotics, and navigation systems due to its optimality and ability to use domain-specific heuristics to speed up the search.
