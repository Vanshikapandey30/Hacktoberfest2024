# Anagram

## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes two strings as input and determines if they are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another.

Your program should print "Anagram" if the two input strings are anagrams and "Not Anagram" if they are not.

## Input

- Two strings, `str1` and `str2`, consisting of lowercase or uppercase letters and spaces.

## Output

- "Anagram" if the two input strings are anagrams.
- "Not Anagram" if the two input strings are not anagrams.

## Example

#### Input
str1 = "listen"
str2 = "silent"

#### Output
Anagram
