Counting Set Bits
=================

Counting set bits in an integer is the process of determining how many bits are set to 1 in its binary representation. This is useful in various applications, including algorithms, data compression, and cryptography.

Basic Concepts
--------------

*   A **set bit** is a bit that is equal to 1.
*   For example, the integer 5 has a binary representation of `101`, which has two set bits.
*   The task is to find the total number of set bits for a given integer.

Methods for Counting Set Bits
-----------------------------

*   **Naive Method:** Convert the integer to binary and count the number of 1s.
*   **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm:** Repeatedly turn off the rightmost set bit and count how many times this operation is performed.
*   **Lookup Table Method:** Use a precomputed table to count bits for small values and aggregate results for larger integers.

Java Code Implementation
------------------------

    
    public class CountSetBits {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int number = 29; // Example number
            System.out.println("Number of set bits in " + number + " is: " + countSetBits(number));
        }
    
        // Function to count set bits using Brian Kernighan's Algorithm
        public static int countSetBits(int n) {
            int count = 0;
            while (n > 0) {
                n &= (n - 1); // Clear the least significant bit set
                count++;
            }
            return count;
        }
    }
        

Explanation of the Code
-----------------------

*   The `countSetBits` method implements Brian Kernighan's Algorithm, which efficiently counts set bits.
*   In each iteration, the least significant set bit is cleared using the expression `n &= (n - 1)`.
*   The `count` variable keeps track of how many times this operation is performed until `n` becomes zero.

Key Points
----------

*   **Efficiency:** Brian Kernighan's algorithm is more efficient than the naive method, especially for large numbers.
*   **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is **O(k)**, where `k` is the number of set bits in the integer.
*   **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(1)** as no additional space is used.
*   **Applications:** Counting set bits is useful in areas like cryptography, error detection, and optimization problems.
